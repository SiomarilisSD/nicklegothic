# type-single-page
 
## What I learned
I learned how to do a single paged website but also a mulitpaged website. It was more difficult, but with the help of copilot, and my friends I was able to figure out more, and learn how to navigate through code even more. 

## Branding
For the project I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and experiment with a unique style. I am use to cottage core, and academia styles. So for this project I wanted to imbrace the boldness of the Nickel Gothic font, and did Noir style. Making typography illustrations for the background of the website that are blured out to match the theme. 

## Accessability 
I wanted to keep the project to the point and easy enough for the views to understand what they are doing. I used mainly greys and blacks, white being bold colors, and red for the pop of color. I wanted it to be easy to read and view. Nothing to colorful as it would be more difficult to read. I made the backgrounds blured to be able to read what is infront of your eyes as well.
